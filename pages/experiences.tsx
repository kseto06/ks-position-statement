                    My many engineering extracurricular experiences includes Robotics team programming lead, software developer positions, 
                    and most recently a reinforcement learning lead developer in UofTâ€™s Machine Intelligence Student Team. My continuous passion for exploring these 
                    fields have heavily influenced by perspective on how I approach engineering.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In my engineering experiences, I always have to tackle high-stake problems. In my Robotics team, I led developers and created complex programs
                    with the hope of being able to qualify for the FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics World Championships in Houston. Currently, I am leading 
                    UTMIST's prime reinforcement learning project to develop a tournament/hackathon for over 250 participants/stakeholders. I interpret engineering design 
                    as a powerful tool where the concepts learned can be applied to show a vision of what I want to create, and how to layout and combine the pieces to get to an ultimate goal. 
                    For example, being UTMIST's lead developer, I am constantly applying NGO frameworks to keep my team on the scope of the project and FDCR to brainstorm and implement ideas in code.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Since I am constantly tackling large problems that involve many stakeholders, I engage in engineering design always trying to think ahead of what I want my end goal to be to try to maximize efficiency. 
                    I am constantly diverging and converging of what I want to design and produce for a project, even at the framing stage when I am only finding an opportunity; this allows me to think of an ultimate goal 
                    that I want to achieve and it provides me with better motivation to tackle and finish a project. For example, in my community pitch I identify cyclists in downtown Toronto who are at risk of injuries
                    due to reckless driving. When I was ideating and framing this opportunity, I was already diverging ideas and designs in areas that I am interested in, such as designing computer vision systems to improve
                    the safety of the bikers.
