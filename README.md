## ESC102 Position Statement

This web development project is the "creative theme" of my position statement, programming in React.ts & Tailwind CSS. 

Here, I discuss my experiences and perspective on engineering design after going through one semester of Engineering Science, Praxis I (Semester 1 Engineering Design course), and my past engineering and STEM-related extracurriculars/experiences.
